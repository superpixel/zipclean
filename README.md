# About zipclean

zipclean is a very simple droplet wrapper to delete the macOS specific **.DS_Store** files and the **__MACOSX** folder in ZIP archives you drop on it.

## Install

Copy and Paste the following line at a terminal prompt on your Mac:

```sh
/bin/bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/superpixel/zipclean/master/install.sh)
```

This will compile the zipclean droplet to your desktop.
